      "Declared source count is 8 but only 4 references are listed; mismatch and incomplete bibliography.",
      "References are placeholders without bibliographic details (authors, titles, dates, links) and mainly support report structure rather than technical claims.",
      "Many technical assertions (privacy redaction efficacy, hybrid inference decisioning, on‑device vector search feasibility, thermal/energy constraints) lack citations or empirical evidence despite the presence of a references section.",
      "No explicit threat model or trust boundaries; missing treatment of prompt injection, jailbreaks, tool‑output sanitization, and compromised tool scenarios.",
      "On‑device model strategy is underspecified: no candidate models, parameter counts, quantization schemes, memory/CPU/NPU targets, latency/accuracy trade‑offs, or provider comparison criteria.",
      "Rollback semantics are vague for irreversible actions (e.g., messages sent); no idempotency, compensating actions, outbox/transaction patterns, or side‑effect scoping.",
      "Security gaps: key management and secret storage (Keychain/Secure Enclave/Android Keystore), token refresh, encryption at rest/in transit, and code/package integrity are not specified.",
      "Mobile OS constraints are not concretely addressed: iOS/Android background execution limits, task resumption, termination handling, thermal throttling policies, and scheduling/backoff strategies.",
      "Tooling safety is high level; lacks concrete sandboxing/isolation model, permission scoping enforcement mechanics, and least‑privilege credential handling per tool.",
      "Interface and schema evolution concerns are missing: versioning, backward compatibility, and cross‑platform serialization (Swift/Kotlin/Protobuf/JSON) details.",
      "Observability may be insufficient for debugging if only tool names are logged; no plan for privacy‑preserving payload traces (e.g., redacted/hashing strategies) or tamper‑evident audit logs.",
      "Data governance/compliance not covered: data retention/TTL, user data export/deletion (GDPR/CCPA/DSAR), consent management, and privacy manifests (iOS/Android).",
      "Evaluation lacks concrete targets and baselines: no specific SLIs/SLOs (latency budgets, tool‑call caps per scenario, success rates), datasets, or benchmarking methodology.",
      "Performance/cost sections lack quantified budgets (tokens/sec, cold/warm start times, memory/flash footprint, power draw) and workload modeling.",
      "Safety filtering and content moderation approaches (toxicity/PII/NSFW) are not defined, nor are their on‑device feasibility and accuracy/latency trade‑offs.",
      "No comparison to existing agent frameworks/tooling relevant to mobile (e.g., ReAct/Toolformer patterns, mobile agent SDKs); alternatives analysis is shallow.",
      "State sync and multi‑device considerations (conflict resolution, merge/diff of context/memory) are not discussed.",
      "No diagrams or trust‑boundary visuals to ground the architecture and data flows."
